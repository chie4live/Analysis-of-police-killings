Police killing of civilians in the US in from January 2015 to June 2015.

Due in part to recent high-profile shootings of civilians by police in the US, the media and public have been scrutinizing police killings heavily. If you browse social media and news sites, you may get the sense that there's been a large uptick in civilian shootings by police in the US.

I want to investigate police killings more and get to the facts as part of a project in Dataquest.
